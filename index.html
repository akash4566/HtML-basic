     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Hello there! I'm <b>Akash Sanuria </b> a passionate web developer with a focus on <u>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js</u>. I love turning ideas into interactive and user-friendly websites. </p>
     <p> <b>My journey </b>in web development began with a curiosity for the digital world. As I delved into <u>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</u>, I discovered my knack for creating visually appealing and functional web experiences.</p>
     <p>With a <b>Strong foundation</b> in the core web technologies, I embraced the power of <u>React and Node.js</u> to build dynamic and scalable applications. The ability to craft frontend interfaces with React and manage server-side operations with Node.js allows me to create seamless end-to-end solutions.
